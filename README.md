# Build-an-AI-Product-Description-Generator-using-Gemini-Pro
This project demonstrates how to deploy a Google Gemini Pro machine learning model for generating product descriptions automatically. 

An AI-powered product description generator using Gemini Pro and HugginFace Flan-T5 models. 

Given the name of the product, key features, and optionally the product category, this streamlit app uses a Flan-T5 model to generate the product category and then uses all this information to generate a compelling product description.
